# My first solo clone

Using what I learned from the Clever Programmer Netflix Clone tutorial to create my own Funimation Clone.

It will utilize the same tools, such as React, Firebase, Javascript, HTML/CSS, and the TMDB API.

My goal is the first get a desktop clone up and running. Then I will work to also get it to be responsive for both medium and small screens.
